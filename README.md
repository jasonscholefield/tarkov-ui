# Tarkov UI

This project will attempt to demonstrate my solution to Tarkov's cluttered UI while learning React and Styled Components.

This project is based on preliminary mockups that are below. These mockups should be used as a starting point and are not meant as a pixel perfect expectation. Screens will be expanded upon or changed beyond these.

The idea behind these screens is a light redesign. This is **not** an attempt to redesign the entire UI. That may come later on if I pivot to learning how to theme with Styled Components.

#### Workbench

Cleaning up the interface for the workbench to allow for easier use.

#### Item Modal Updates

Taking some information that is gatekeeped in spreadsheets and placing it in tooltips on when relevant.

#### Home Screen

Making the home screen a bit more interesting. The last map you played is featured in the background, possibly as a video. If video is played test with some minor sound clips (Labs alarm noise / voice, Interchange Killa RPK in the distance, Woods Shturman SVD spam, Shoreline beach ambient noise, etc). If you logged on only to collect bitcoins or did not enter a raid then you will see the Hideout screen next time you login.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
